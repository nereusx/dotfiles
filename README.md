## Help files
Help files are written for 132x35 terminals

## WARNING

* I use BRIEF's text editor keys ***everywhere***, even in tcsh
* with minor exception like joe, where I use WordStar keys

## Notes
1. in `src` directory it is a utility (in C) to trim the PATH;
	this will be installed at /bin
2. local-bin could be installed at ~/.bin
3. [t]csh is true that it has the worst parser, that creates bugs;
	on the other hand, just use spaces and you'll find none (undocumented);
	tcsh is rich of features and still is too light comparing with bash or ksh;
	interactive mode it is excellent; if you want something more use a real language.
4. all are free under GPL; a few are not mine
5. in .jed directory there is the 'terminal.sl' file to change escape key codes;
	yep, in 2019 and still terminals in every distro has incompatibilities
