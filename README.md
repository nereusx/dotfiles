## Help files
Help files are written for 132x35 terminals

## WARNING

* I use BRIEF's text editor keys ***everywhere***, even in tcsh
* with minor exception like joe, where I use WordStar keys

## Notes
1. local-bin could be installed at ~/.bin instead of /usr/local/bin
2. all are free under GPL; a few are not mine
3. in .jed directory there is the 'terminal.sl' file to change escape key codes;
	yep, in 2019 and still terminals in every distro has incompatibilities
