-- mksh ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>file   :  standard output is redirected to file
>>file  :  same as >, except if file exists it is appended to instead of being truncated
<file   :  standard input is redirected from file, which is opened for reading
<>file  :  same as <, except the file is opened for reading and writing
<<mark  :  here document
<<-mark :  same as <<, except leading tabs are stripped from lines in the here document
<<<word :  same as <<, except that word is the here document. this is called a here string
<&fd    :  standard input is duplicated from file descriptor fd. fd can be a single digit, indicating the number of an existing
           file descriptor; the letter 'p', indicating the file descriptor associated with the output of the current co-process;
           or the character '-', indicating standard input is to be closed.
>&fd    :  same as <&, except the operation is done on standard output.
&>file  :  same as >file 2>&1. This is a deprecated (legacy) GNU bash extension supported by mksh which also supports the
           preceding explicit fd digit, for example, 3&>file is the same as 3>file
&>|file, &>>file, &>&fd
        :  same as >|file, >>file or >&fd, followed by 2>&1, as above.
-- commands -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(list)     :  execute list in a subshell. There is no implicit way to pass environment changes from a subshell back to its parent
{ list; }  :  compound construct; list is executed, but not in a subshell
case word in [[(] pattern [| pattern] ...) list terminator] ... esac
           terminators: ;; exit list; ;& fall into the next; ;| evaluate the remaining pattern-list tuples
for name [in word ...]; do list; done
if list; then list; [elif list; then list;] ... [else list;] fi
select name [in word ...]; do list; done
until list; do list; done
while list; do list; done
function name { list; }
(( expression )) : The arithmetic expression expression is evaluated
[[ expression ]] : Similar to the test and [ ... ] commands (described later), with some exceptions
$(<foo)       : has the same effect as $(cat foo)
-- mksh modifiers -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
${name:-word} : if name is set and not empty, it is substituted; otherwise, word is substituted.
${name:+word} : if name is set and not empty, word is substituted; otherwise, nothing is substituted.
${name:=word} : if name is set and not empty, it is substituted; otherwise, it is assigned word and the resulting value of name is substituted.
${name:?word} : if name is set and not empty, it is substituted; otherwise, word is printed on standard error (preceded by name:)
             and an error occurs (normally causing termination of a shell script, function, or a script sourced using the "."
             built-in). If word is omitted, the string "parameter null or not set" is used instead
-- mksh variables -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
${#name}     :  the length (in characters) of the string value of parameter name
${#name[*]} or ${#name[@]}  :  the number of elements in the array name.
${%name}     :  the width (in screen columns) of the string value of parameter name, or -1 if ${name} contains a control character.
${!name}     :  the name of the variable referred to by name. This will be name except when name is a name reference
             (bound variable), created by the nameref command (which is an alias for typeset -n). name cannot be one of most
             special parameters (see below).
${!name[*]} or ${!name[@]}  :  the names of indices (keys) in the array name.
${name#pattern} or ${name##pattern}  
             If pattern matches the beginning of the value of parameter name, the matched text is deleted from the result of
             substitution. A single '#' results in the shortest match, and two of them result in the longest match.
             Cannot be applied to a vector (${*} or ${@} or ${array[*]} or ${array[@]}).
${name%pattern} or ${name%%pattern}
             like ${...#...} substitution, but it deletes from the end of the value. Cannot be applied to a vector.
${name/pattern/string} or ${name/#pattern/string} or ${name/%pattern/string} or ${name//pattern/string}
             the longest match of pattern in the value of parameter name is replaced with string (deleted if string is empty;
             the trailing slash ('/') may be omitted in that case). A leading slash followed by '#' or '%' causes the pattern to
             be anchored at the beginning or end of the value, respectively; empty unanchored patterns cause no replacement;
             a single leading slash or use of a pattern that matches the empty string causes the replacement to happen only once;
             two leading slashes cause all occurrences of matches in the value to be replaced. Cannot be applied to a vector.
${name@/pattern/string} : as ${name//pattern/string}, except that both pattern and string are expanded anew for each iteration.
${name:pos:len} : the first len characters of name, starting at position pos, are substituted; both pos and :len are optional.
			 If pos is negative, counting starts at the end of the string; if it is omitted, it defaults to 0. 
			 If len is omitted or greater than the length of the remaining string, all of it is substituted. Both pos and len
             are evaluated as arithmetic expressions. Currently, pos must start with a space, opening parenthesis or digit to
			 be recognised. Cannot be applied to a vector.
${name@#}  :  the hash (using the BAFH algorithm) of the expansion of name.
${name@Q}  :  a quoted expression safe for re-entry, whose value is the value of the name parameter, is substituted.
$!  :  process ID of the last background process started. If no back ground processes have been started, the parameter is not set.
$#  :  the number of positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.).
$$  :  the PID of the shell or, if it is a subshell, the PID of the original shell.
$-  :  the concatenation of the current single letter options (see the set command below for a list of options).
$?  :  the exit status of the last non-asynchronous command executed.
$0  :  the name of the shell or shellscript, (argv[0] in C).
${num} or $1..9 : the parameters that were supplied to the shell, function, or script.
$*  :  all positional parameters (except 0), i.e. $1, $2, $3, ...
$@  :  same as $*, unless it is used inside double quotes, in which case a separate word is generated for each positional
       parameter. If there are no positional parameters, no word is generated.
