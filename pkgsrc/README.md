# NetBSD packages for Linux

You can use NetBSD ports instead of official distro's repositories, maybe in most cases this is not a good idea,
but you can use it as additional repository when you need it.
As for me, I really like BSD more than Linux, but I prefer Linux kernel for its compatibility with several devices.
